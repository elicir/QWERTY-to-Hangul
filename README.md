# QWERTY-to-Hangul
A converter between alphabet characters and Dubeolsik keyboard hangul input.

The most commonly used Korean 2-Set keyboard uses a QWERTY keyboard mapped to Korean letters, with each key corresponding to a letter and some accessible using SHIFT. Hangul (the Korean writing system) blocks are these letters grouped together into syllables.

The mapping of QWERTY keys to Hangul letters allows for people to type in Korean in alphabet letters, either for fun original usernames, to type somewhat in code, etc. For example, Korean singer IU's Instagram username is dlwlrma (equivalent to 이지금 [right now], a word play on her full name 이지은).

This converter converts the alphabet letter key entered to the Hangul letter that it's mapped to, and vice versa. 
Inspired by trying to type in English while accidentally still using the Korean keyboard. Way too many times.
